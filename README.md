# Personal-Expense-Tracker

Having a good spending habit is essential to maintaining a healthy personal financial status. To
facilitate the process, a personal expense tracker may help, which is an application that help users to
keep track of their income and spendings, as well as allocating the money systemically for various
purposes (e.g., saving, investment and charity). The program allows its user to input their income(s), spendings and
other allocations. Here are the functions of the system:
- Input/store/update/retrieve the income(s), spendings and other allocations
- Display the total income of last year
- Display the top three spendings in the past 30 days
